Here's what each debug channel shows:

debug[0] = State number

0 = IDLE
1 = SETUP
2 = WAIT_STABLE
3 = EXCITE
4 = MEASURE
5 = ANALYZE
6 = ADJUST
7 = COMPLETE
8 = ABORTED
debug[1] = Sample count / Markers

During EXCITE/MEASURE: increments as samples collected (0-200)
Special values:
1000 = Activation marker
2000 = Deactivation marker
3333 = Excitation start marker
4444 = Measurement start marker
5555 = Analysis start marker
debug[2] = Gyro rate (deg/s) on current axis being tested

debug[3] = Excitation signal (deg/s)

Should show +100 (or +300 if you changed it) during first half of doublet
Should show -100 (or -300) during second half of doublet
0 otherwise
debug[4] = Safety check status

0 = All checks passed
1 = Attitude check failed (>30°)
2 = Gyro rate check failed (>500 deg/s)
3 = Throttle check failed (<20% or >80%)
4 = Stick deflection check failed (>20%)
debug[5] = Throttle percentage (0-100)

debug[6] = Maximum stick deflection percentage (0-100)

debug[7] = Time elapsed in doublet (milliseconds) - only during EXCITE state

Key thing to check: debug[3] should show clear positive/negative pulses during state 3 (EXCITE). If it stays at 0, the excitation isn't being generated or applied.
